## Timer Test

### Challenges

Using Laravel framework was not much of a challenge at all the whole framework was well thought out
the developers behind the framework seems to be well aware of the design flaws in PHP, such as lack of
'lexical scoping', while working with that framework I have touch the keyword 'global' which is very easy
to forget.

The main challenges were mainly getting the database design right and doing the math with timers.

### What would I do next?

If I had a bit more time, I would of learned Angular.js and implemented it into the application.  Because Angular.js uses the same syntax as Blade Templating system, meaning I have to change the syntax in either Angular or Blade, or just use raw PHP.

### What would I do differently, if I started the task again?

I would got the timer right, I felt that I didn't do it the proper way, mainly because I had limited time, deadline and other things is life, such as working out at the Gym.
